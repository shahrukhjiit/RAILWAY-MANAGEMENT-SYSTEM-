# RAILWAY-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM-

## Why This Project
The decision to undertake this project stems from its capability to integrate various concepts of data structures and algorithms. Its potential to be utilized as a real-time solution for travelers and passengers was also a motivating factor. Leveraging our proficiency in the C++ programming language, we aimed to develop a railway management system.

## Objectives
Explore and demonstrate stored information.
Utilize vectors to assemble a train from different coaches.
Implement Maps (int to string) for mapping stations to locations.
Utilize Graphs to formulate routes for trains.
Implement file handling to store train information in a text file.
Incorporate concepts of linked lists, vectors, and graphs learned through the course curriculum.

## Approach
Project Conception and Initiation
The initial concept involved leveraging data structures learned throughout the course curriculum and applying them to railway management. Railways play a crucial role in transportation, and optimizing their management system contributes to ease of usage.

## Project Definition and Planning
Project definition entails the utilization of vectors, graphs, and file handling, along with graph traversal concepts, to efficiently manage railway operations.

## Project Launch and Execution
Project launch involves debugging errors in the codebase and acclimating to different file formats for seamless execution.

## Conclusion & Future Work
### Conclusion

The project encompasses various functionalities:
Searching for trains by Train ID or source and destination stations.
Displaying train details.
Adding paths between two locations.
Checking for all available routes.
Moreover, the project exhibits potential for real-world applications, aiding organizations like IRCTC in maintaining and tracking records for future reference.

### Future Work
Modify the project to incorporate weighted graphs to find the shortest route between stations.
Implement functionality to check time between stations using average train speeds.
Utilize boolean arrays alongside Train ID to manage seat availability and bookings.
Incorporate N-Array Trees for structured berth allotment.
Implement Doubly Linked Lists to connect train coaches for further division.
